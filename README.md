## Atlantic hurricane season

The Atlantic hurricane season is the period in a year when hurricanes usually form in the Atlantic Ocean. In the Northern Atlantic Ocean, a distinct hurricane season occurs from June 1 to November 30, sharply peaking from late August through September. 

The 2020 Atlantic hurricane season is the first hurricane season on record in which nine tropical storms formed before August 1. The animation shows complete data for the Atlantic hurricane seasons between 1990 and 2019.  

The most active season was 2005, during which 28 tropical cyclones formed, of which a record 15 became hurricanes. The least active season all time was 1914, with only one known tropical cyclone developing during that year.

Hurricane Mitch is the second-deadliest Atlantic hurricane on record, causing over 11,000 fatalities in Central America in 1998. The deadliest being [the Great Hurricane of 1790](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Great_Hurricane_of_1780).
